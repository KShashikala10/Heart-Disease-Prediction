## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System** that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.
The system uses a trained model on the **Heart Disease dataset** and provides a simple **web interface** for user input.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🧠 Machine learning model trained on heart disease dataset
* 🌐 Web-based user interface for predictions
* 📊 Takes common medical attributes as input
* ✅ Provides instant results (prediction: heart disease or not)
* 🔬 Built using **Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Scikit-learn**

## 📊 Input Parameters

The web form accepts the following attributes:

* `Sex` (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
* `ChestPainType`
* `RestingBP`
* `Cholesterol`
* `FastingBS`
* `RestingECG`
* `MaxHR`

* `Oldpeak`
* `ST_Slope`

---

## 📈 Model Performance

* Dataset: **Heart Disease Dataset**
* Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
* Final Selected Model: Logistic Regression (for balance of accuracy and interpretability)
* Accuracy Achieved: **~85%** (depending on dataset split)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
